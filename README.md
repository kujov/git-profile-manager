# Git Profile Manager

## Installation

I'm working to make the installation possible with Homebrew.

## Usage

The Git Profile Manager includes the following actions:
- get: shows active profile
- set: switches profiles to predefined ones in the config
- edit: opens config file with ```vi```
- list: lists all the profiles in the config

Create a new profile:
either edit the config with ```gpm edit```

## Development

To build the package use:
```console
pip install -e .
```

Also install the requirements and create a venv.
